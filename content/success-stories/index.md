    description: "Partage dans le monde is a humanitarian association composed entirely of volunteers. We have been carrying out actions in India since 1993 and in Nepal since 2000. Since its creation, Doctor Byramjee, its founder, has established medical and social missions in support of extremely disadvantaged populations in partnership with local structures. Two annual missions are necessary to meet the population's needs and sustain our on-the-ground actions.",

    description: "Since 1993, we have been carrying out medical, social, and educational activities in favour of indigent populations in South India. Among other things, we have carried out 200,000 consultations, financed and managed 4 dispensaries, a sewing workshop, two 4X4s, and an ambulance. Needs have evolved in India since 1993, and access to care is better managed by government and private structures. Partage dans le monde nevertheless maintains a presence through 2 medico-social centres, under the responsibility of its local partner Partage dans le monde Puducherry.",
