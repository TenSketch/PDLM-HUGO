The site consists of two buildings, now used by Satya School, a socio-educational structure welcoming children with special needs daily. About fifty children are supervised by specialised educators.

Through this partnership, we aim to offer these young individuals not only access to education, but also the opportunity to build a better future for themselves and their communities. We believe that every child deserves the chance to learn, grow, and thrive-regardless of their circumstances.
